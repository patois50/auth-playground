# Spring JWT Demo

## Description
This is a demo project for an authentication service using JWTs.

I created it only for playing around with JWTs using Spring.

It should not be used in production!

## API

```
actuator/health --> View the health of the application

actuator/info --> View information about the application

actuator --> 
```
